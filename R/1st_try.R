#Problem 1: Find the login of John Insecure.
# Bit has scrapped 'employees' data (names and logins) from the www web page of Technical University of Warsaw. The data is in the data.frame `employees`. 
# Now, your task is to find John Insecure's login.
# When you finally find out what John's login is, use `proton(action = "login", login="XYZ")` command, where XYZ is Insecure's login.

# Congratulations! You have found out what John Insecure's login is!
# It is highly likely that he uses some typical password.
# Bit downloaded from the Internet a database with 1000 most commonly used passwords.
# You can find this database in the `top1000passwords` vector.
# 
# Problem 2: Find John Insecure's password.
# 
# Use `proton(action = "login", login="XYZ", password="ABC")` command in order to log into the Proton server with the given credentials.
# If the password is correct, you will get the following message:
#   `Success! User is logged in!`.
# Otherwise you will get:
#   `Password or login is incorrect!`.

# Well done! This is the right password!
#   Bit used John Insecure's account in order to log into the Proton server.
# It turns out that John has access to server logs.
# Now, Bit wants to check from which workstation Pietraszko is frequently logging into the Proton server. Bit hopes that there will be some useful data.  
# 
# Logs are in the `logs` dataset. 
# Consecutive columns contain information such as: who, when and from which computer logged into Proton.
# 
# Problem 3: Check from which server Pietraszko logs into the Proton server most often.
# 
# Use `proton(action = "server", host="XYZ")` command in order to learn more  about what can be found on the XYZ server.
# The biggest chance to find something interesting is to find a server from which Pietraszko logs in the most often.

#             proton.login.pass 
# "Success! User is logged in!"
